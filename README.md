# LogisticRegressionExercise_2
# I get my "breast_cancer.csv" and it is ready to use
# So i make "train_test_split" on my "X" and "y", y is last column X is rest without firs column
# Then I import "LogisticRegression" model and train it """classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)"""
# I get "y_pred" on my "X_test" """y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)"""
